 *  On systems with the CalTech malloc(), the amount of storage
 *  ACTUALLY ALLOCATED is the amount requested rounded UP to the
 *  nearest power of two.  For structures which are acquired and
 *  released often, this works well, but for structures which will
 *  remain unchanged for the duration of the program, this wastes
 *  as much as 50% of the address space (and usually memory as well).
 *  Here, we round up a byte size to the nearest power of two,
 *  leaving off the malloc header, so as to ask for storage without
 *  wasting any.
 *  
 *  On systems with the traditional malloc(), this strategy will just
 *  consume the memory in somewhat larger chunks, but overall little
 *  unused memory will be consumed.
