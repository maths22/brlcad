.TH ANIM_LOOKAT 1 BRL/CAD
.SH NAME
anim_lookat - create a view animation script which looks from an eye point to 
a specified point.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B anim_lookat 
.B [-f #] 
.B < in.table 
.B > out.script
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program takes as input a seven-column animation table
consisting of time, an eye point, and a "look-at point", and prints a
view animation script to control the virtual camera. A similar effect
could be acheived by using the 
.I tabsub 
to create a script which uses the
"lookat_pt" command. The advantage to using 
.I anim_lookat 
instead is that the
camera remains "right side up", and that when the view is vertically up
or down, the orientation is controlled by the previous orientation of the
camera. This avoids sudden jumps as much as possible. 
.PP
The 
.B \-f#
option is used to specify an integer with which to begin
numbering frames. The default is 0.
.SH BUGS
Looking straight up or straight down for two or more frames in a
row may cause errors.
