.SH NAME
Deck \- Generate COM-GEOM decks from a GED database file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B deck
{file}.g
[
.BI object...
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.nf
Deck allows the user to select a list of objects (solids,  regions,  or
groups) from a GED database file and generate a COM-GEOM deck for them.
A list of objects  can be specified when invoking the program or a list
can be selected interactively from the table of contents. String match-
ing operators  like  those used to specify file or directory names from
the UNIX shell are provided for this purpose,  as well as to search for
names in the table of contents.   A list of objects can be edited using
the 'delete' and 'insert' operators.  A deck consists of  three  tables
(solid, region and region-id) and are saved as seperate files. Multiple
decks can be created by specifying unique file name prefixes,  in which
case the tables are suffixed by a ".st", ".rt" and ".id".
.sp
On-line documentation is provided.
