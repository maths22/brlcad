.I Rle-fb\^
decodes a University of Utah standard
Run-Length Encoded (RLE) format file
(saved with
.IR fb-rle\^ (1),
.IR pix-rle (1),
or a similar program),
converts it into

format, and writes it to standard out.
If

is not specified, standard input is read.
.I Rle-pix\^
determines the type and size of the saved file (color or B&W)
