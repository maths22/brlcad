.SH NAME
fbzoom \(em enlarge a frame buffer image
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fbzoom
.RB [ \-hT ]
.RB [ \-F\  framebuffer]
.RB [ \-{sS}\  squarescrsize]
.RB [ \-{wW}\  scr_width]
.RB [ \-{nN}\  scr_height]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Fbzoom\^
is used to
zoom-in
on a frame buffer image by enlarging each pixel and windowing in on
a portion of the image.
The environment
variable
.B
.SM FB_FILE
is used to select the display device (see
.IR brlcad (1)).
If this variable is not set, the default device for your system will
be used.
.PP
The requested framebuffer size will be the default size for the
selected device (often 512x512 pixels).
Specifying the
.B \-h
flag changes the size to 1024x1024.
.PP
The
.BI \-w\  scr_width
and
.BI \-W\  scr_width
flags specifies the width of each scanline for the display device,
in pixels.
.PP
The
.BI \-n\  scr_height
and
.BI \-N\  scr_height
flags specifies the height of each scanline for the display device.
.PP
.BI \-s\  squarescrsize
and
.BI \-S\  squarescrsize
set both the height and width to the size given.
The
.B \-T
flag reverses the sense of the pan commands
(see the discussion of the
.RB `` T ''
command below).
.PP
The 
.IR vi (1)-like
commands
.RB `` h '',
.RB `` j '',
.RB `` k '',
and
.RB `` l ''
pan one pixel left, down, up, and right, respectively,
and the 
.RB `` H '',
.RB `` J '',
.RB `` K '',
and
.RB `` L ''
commands pan in the corresponding directions in big steps.
These commands also have
.IR jove (1)-like
counterparts in the
.RB `` B '',
.RB `` N  '',
.RB `` P '',
and
.RB `` F '',
and
.RB `` ^B '',
(control-B),
.RB `` ^N '',
.RB `` ^P '',
and
.RB `` ^F ''
commands.
The
.RB `` T ''
command toggles the sense of all the pan commands.
Initially (unless the
.B \-T
flag is specified)
the pan commands move the center of view across the image.
When their sense is reversed,
they move the image under the center of view.
.PP
A
.RB `` ? ''
prints a short command summary,
and typing
.RB `` q ''
or
.RB `` Q ''
exits the program.
