.TH PL-FB 1 BRL/CAD
.SH NAME
pl-fb \- display 3-D UNIX plot on a framebuffer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pl-fb
.RB [ \-hoid ]
[filename]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Pl-fb
displays a BRL extended three dimensional UNIX plot file on a framebuffer.
The environment
variable
.B
.SM FB_FILE
is used to select the display device (see
.IR brlcad(1) ).
If this variable is not set, the default device for your system will
be used.
By default, the display size is assumed to be 512x512 pixels.
Specifying the
.B \-h
flag, changes the output size to 1024x1024.
.PP
The
.B \-o
flag is for overlay mode, where the current framebuffer image will
be left in the background.
The
.B \-i
flag causes the rasterized image to be plotted immediately, rather
than buffering up rasterized data into bands.  While useful for
quick feedback on small plots, this mode is generally more expenisve
in CPU time.
The
.B \-d
flag outputs a very verbose debugging stream to standard error
listing every UNIX plot command
and the corresponding framebuffer coordinates.
If
.I filename
is not specified,
the plot commands are read from standard in.
.PP
Note that 3-D UNIX plot is a superset of the standard UNIX plot
format, thus this program can display normal plot files as well.
