.TH FBCMAP 1 BRL/CAD
.SH NAME
fbcmap \- change the color map of a frame buffer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fbcmap
.RB [ \-h ]
[map_number]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Fbcmap
is used to change the color map of a frame buffer.
The environment
variable
.B
.SM FB_FILE
is used to select the display device (see
.IR brlcad (1)).
If this variable is not set, the default device for your system will
be used.
If the
.B \-h
option is used, a
.SM
.B HIRES
(1024x1024x24) framebuffer is written; otherwise a
.SM
.B LORES
(512x512x24) device is assumed.
This size distinction is important only for devices like the Adage
framebuffers which have different operating modes based on the
display size.
.PP
If an optional color
.I map_number
is given, that map is used;
the default is the standard linear map.
There are currently six other maps supplied
numbered 1 through 6 as follows:
.TP
1
reverse-linear (negative) map.
.TP
2
one corrected for Polaroid 809/891 film.
.TP
3
a linear mapping in which the first 100 values are black.
.TP
4
a linear map with values 1->191 incremented by 64 to boost dim pictures.
The values at 191 and above are all full on.  Zero remains at zero.
.TP
5
a gamma correcting color map used by the University of Utah Alpha_1 project.
.TP
6
a map with a series of color deltas.
This map is mostly black with the following colors,
appearing at multiples of 32,
having values full on:
white (0), magenta (32), red (64), yellow (96), green (128),
cyan (160), blue (192).  This map is most useful in conjunction
with
.IR fbcmrot (1)
and will show which pixels have the same intensities in one, two, or
all three color planes.
.PP
There are also three special maps used to quickly change the display
to a solid color for adjusting a camera without losing image memory,
numbered 10 through 12 for
black,
white,
and 18% neutral grey, respectively.
