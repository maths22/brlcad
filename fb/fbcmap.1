.SH NAME
fbcmap \- change the color map of a frame buffer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fbcmap
[
.B \-h
] [ map_number ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Fbcmap
is used to change the color map of a frame buffer.
By default, the device
.B /dev/ik0l
is assumed.
This may be changed by setting the environment
variable
.B
.SM FB_FILE
to the name of another device or file name
and exporting it before execution of 
.IR fbclear\^ .
If the
.B \-h
option is used, the
.SM
.B HIRES
(1024x1024x24) color map is written; otherwise a
.SM
.B LORES
(512x512x24) device is assumed.
If an optional color
.I map_number\^
is given, that map is used; the default
is the standard linear map.
There are currently 4 other maps supplied
numbered 1 through 4 in the following order:
a reverse-linear map, one corrected for Poloroid 809/891 film, a linear
mapping in which the first 100 values are black, and a linear map with
values 1-192 incremented by 64 to boost dim pictures.
