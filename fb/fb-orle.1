.SH NAME
fb-rle \- save a frame buffer image in run-length encoded form
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Fb-rle\^
saves a frame buffer image in a file, using the Alpha_1 standard
Run-Length Encoded (RLE) form.
By default, the device
.B /dev/ik0l
is used for input.
This may be changed by setting the environment
variable
.B
.SM FB_FILE
to the name of another device or file name
and exporting it before execution of 
.IR fb-rle\^ .
Images may be read from disk or any supported frame buffer device.
If
.I file.rle\^
is not specified, the encoded file is written to the standard output.
.I Fb-rle\^
attempts to compress flat-colored areas
as much as possible.
This means that it is reasonable to save the entire
screen, since it will not take up much more file space than saving only the
interesting portion of the image.
The default action is to save only data
pixels and to save the background color separately, so that when the image
is restored all non-image pixels will be set to the background pixel value
stored in the RLE header.
Images saved in this mode may be displayed normally, or in ``overlay''
mode by the RLE decoder program (see
.IR rle-fb\^ (1V)).
Alternatively, the
.B \-S
option may be used to RLE encode the background as well (recommended only
if you don't have a flat background).
.TP
.B \-C
Convert (``crunch'') an image with a non-standard color map so that the
RLE file created will redisplay with a standard color map.
Useful to preserve dramatic images created with wierd color maps
so that Gamma correction (for film) can also be applied.
This option is recommended when producing images for export to other
display systems, so that variations in the processing of color maps
between display hardware do not affect the displayed image.
.TP
.B \-w
Convert the color image to black and white, and RLE encode that.
The red, green, and blue components of each
pixel are combined via the NTSC transform to get an intensity value (Y) which
is saved.
.TP
.B \-S
Save all data in RLE format,
irrespective of whether it is background or not (``straight box save'').
It is not possible to
restore a file saved with 
.B \-S
as an overlay.
.TP
.BI \-c x
Specify a color to use as the ``background''.
The character
.I x\^
is selected from the set
.B rgbwBG
(red, green, blue, white, Black, 18% Grey).
If this option is not specified, the pixel in the lower left corner
of the region being saved is used as the background color.
.TP
.BI \-l "x y"
Specify the size of the saved box.
This is useful if only a portion of the image is to be saved.
.TP
.BI \-p "x y"
Specify the upper left corner of the saved portion
of the image.
.TP
.B \-v
(Verbose mode.)
The program will provide voluminous status information
on its standard error as it proceeds through encoding the image.
.TP
.B \-h
.SM
.B HIRES
mode.
This flag causes the image in the frame buffer to be read back
in
.SM
.B HIRES
(1024x1024x24) mode;
the default is to read the image back
in
.SM
.B LORES
(512x512x24) mode.
.TP
.I file.rle
Output file.
.SH EXAMPLE
.RS

$ \fIfb-rle \|\-h \|tank.rle\fR

.SH WARNING
If no output file is specified, the user should be careful to re-direct
the output to a file or pipe, as the encoded form is in binary.
In doing
so, be sure not to merge the standard error with the standard output as
this will potentially foil the decoding step, especially if the
verbose option was used.

.SH BUGS
The ability to save less than the whole image is not presently implemented.
It would be nice if this program could determine the mode
.RB ( \s-1HIRES\s0
.I vs.\^
.BR \s-1LORES\s0 )
of the frame buffer, rather than needing the
.B \-h
flag.
Unfortunately,
the hardware control registers may be write-only (as with the Ikonas),
so there is no way of telling.
