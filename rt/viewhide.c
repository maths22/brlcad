 *
 *  Ray Tracing program RTHIDE bottom half.
 *
 *  This module utilizes the RT library to interrogate a MGED
 *  model.  It consists of a front end that writes a ray data
 *  file, and a post-processor, which reads said file and is
 *  responsible for producing the UnixPlot file.
 *
 *  At present, the main use for this module is to generate
 *  UnixPlot file that can be read by various existing filters
 *  to produce a bas-relief line drawing of an MGED object: i.e.
 *  flat when viewed head-on, but with relief detail when seen at
 *  an angle.
 *
 *  This is based on previous work done by Michael John Muuss.
