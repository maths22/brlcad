.SH NAME
lgt \- produce a shaded image of an
.I mged\^
model
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lgt
[ options... ] model.g objects...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
.I Lgt\^
is an image rendering tool for the
.IR mged\^ (1)
solids modeling data base.  The program can run interactively or detached
from a terminal session (batch mode).
There are numerous command-line options.
.SS Options
.TP "\w'-b ``R G B\'\'\    |'u"
.BI \-a n\^
Set the number of degrees of roll on the grid to
.IR n\^ .
This is a rotation of the viewing grid about the viewing axis.
.TP
.BI \-c n\^
Set the tracking-cursor flag to
.IR n\^ .
When set to non-zero, this causes an
arrow cursor to point at the current scan line being ray traced, assuming that
a graphics device is being used.  The default is to disable the tracking-cursor.
.TP
.BI \-e n\^
Set the debug flag to
.IR n\^ .
This flag is for the developer/maintainer of
.IR lgt\^ (1)
and
.IR librt\^ (3),
and sets a hexidecimal bitmask to
turn on or off diagnostics.
.TP
.BI \-f n\^
Specify the distance from the origin of the grid to the model centroid as
.I n\^ 
millimeters.
.TP
.BI \-g n\^
Set the field-of-view to
.IR n\^ .
The default is 1.0, and is guaranteed to include the entire model
as long as observer and grid positioning defaults are used.
The field-of-view is actually a scaling factor that is applied
to the grid, and can be knocked out of adjustment by tweaking other parameters
such as grid distance, viewing distance or, in general, perspective.
.TP
.BI \-i n\^
Set noise threshold for the Infrared (IR) Module to
.IR n\^ .
.TP
.BI \-k n\^
Set hidden-line flag to
.IR n\^ .
When set to non-zero, this causes a hidden-line drawing to be produced rather
than the usual shaded color image.
The default is to disable this feature.
.TP
.BI \-n n\^
Set number of processors to use for ray tracing to
.IR n\^ .
This parameter is only meaningful when running in a parallel processing
environment.
The default is set by the ray trace library, in a host-dependent manner,
to the maximum number of processors available in a parallel configuration.
.TP
.BI \-p n\^
Set the relative perspective to
.IR n\^ .
When this number is positive, the relative distance of the grid and the observer
from the model centroid will be adjusted automatically to yield the specified ray
divergence factor (rays emanating from a point, the observer position, to the
respective grid cells).
When set to zero, there is no perspective (parallel rays).
Perspective increases in direct proportion to this number; the default is 0.25.
When
.I n\^
is negative, perspective is governed by the position of the observer (eye) and
grid.
.TP
.BI \-s n\^
If
.I n\^
is non-zero, enter the Infrared Module.
.TP
.BI \-A n\^
Set over-sampling factor to
.IR n\^ .
This is a simple anti-aliasing technique which ray traces an
.I n\^
by
.I n\^
array of pixels and then outputs a linear average of the result.
.TP
.BI \-G n\^
Set grid resolution to
.IR n\^ .
This specifies the number of rays to fire in both the
.I X\^
and
.I Y\^
directions (square grid).  The default is 32 (32x32), and the maximum 
is 1024.
.TP
.BI \-K n\^
Set maximum number of bounces (levels of recursion) in ray tracing.
For instance, it requires one bounce to get through a transparent object or to
get the first reflection off of a mirrored surface.
If no transparent objects or mirrors are modeled,
it is more efficient to leave this at the default of zero.
.TP
.BI \-o file\^
Write image output in
.I file\^
or display on
.IR device\^ .
By default the output is displayed on a frame buffer.  The default frame buffer
is configured by the frame buffer library (see
.IR libfb\^ (3B)),
based on available graphics devices.  The default may be overridden more generally
with the environment variable
.SM
.B FB_FILE
(see
.IR brlcad\^ (1)).
.TP
.BI \-v file\^
Read light source data base from
.IR file\^ .
.TP
.BI \-w file\^
Read material data base from
.IR file\^ .
.TP
.BI \-I file\^
Read and display infrared data from
.IR file\^ .
.TP
.BI \-O file\^
Write errors to
.I file\^
rather than the terminal.  The default is to write to the standard output in a
scrolling window (sub-section of the terminal screen), if the standard
input is attached to the terminal; or to standard error, if input has been
redirected.
.TP
.BI \-T file\^
Read texture map from
.IR file\^ .
.TP
.BI \-d "``x y''"\^
Set automatic mapping offsets to
.I x\^
and
.I y\^
in the IR Module.
.TP
.BI \-t "``x y''"\^
Set the grid translation to
.I x\^
and
.IR y\^ .
This offsets the grid within the grid plane (perpendicular to the viewing axis).
.TP
.BI \-D "``x y''"\^
Set the image translation to
.I x\^
and
.IR y\^ .
This offsets the image relative to the display origin.
.TP
.BI \-x "``a b''"\^
Set the starting and ending pixel to
.I a\^
and
.IR b\^ .
This sets up left and right boundaries within the grid to limit the ray trace
to a rectangular sub-grid.
.TP
.BI \-y "``a b''"\^
Set the starting and ending scan line to
.I a\^
and
.I b\^
in the sub-grid.
.TP
.BI \-X n\^
Set the overlap reporting flag to
.IR n\^ .
When set to non-zero, this causes overlaps to be reported to the log file
or terminal (see the
.B \-O
option).
The default is to report overlaps.
.TP
.BI \-b "``R G B''"\^
Set the background color to
.IR "R G B"\^ .
.P
Required arguments to the program are
.I model.g\^
which is the name of the
.IR mged\^ (1)
data base, followed by one or more
.I objects\^
which are names of regions or groups in the geometry hierarchy which
are to be rendered.
Commands are read from the standard input, whether in batch mode or interactive.
In general, all command-line options can be invoked as commands,
by using the identical option letter,
but there are a few commands that are not available as command-line options.
.SS "Commands (not available as options)"
Arguments that appear in brackets are optional.
In general, when an optional file argument is left out, the user will be prompted;
and if a flag is omitted, the state will be toggled (unless otherwise specified
below):
.TP "\w'! [command [arg...]]    |'u"
.B ?
Print the menu of available commands.
.TP
.BR ! "\ [command [arg...]]"
Execute
.I command\^
from the shell.
If the environment variable $SHELL is set, it will be executed, otherwise
.I /bin/sh\^
is the default shell.
If a
.I command\^
is specified, the shell will be fed it as input (along with any arguments),
otherwise, an interactive shell is spawned.
.TP
.BR . "\ [flag]"
Set buffered pixel I/O to
.IR flag\^ .
The values for specifying the buffering scheme are as follows:
.RS
.TP
.B 0
Programmed I/O.
Each pixel is output immediately after it is calculated.
.TP
.B 1
Paged I/O.
This is generally the most efficient I/O scheme, but only updates the image
as it crosses a page boundary.  Page sizes vary with the graphics device
and host, but range from 8 to 42 scan lines.
.TP
.B 2
Scan line I/O.
Each row of pixels is output when ready.
.P
In the absence of
.IR flag\^ ,
the state is cyclicly incremented.
.RE
.TP
.BR # "\ [comment]"
Nop.
This is the comment command, useful for preparing input files.
.TP
.B B
Submit a batch run.  The current parameters are used to build a script
in a temporary file, and this is submitted to the batch queue (see
.IR batch\^ (1)),
subject to MDQS availability.
The user will be sent mail when the job is finished.
.TP
.B C
Enter cursor input module.  The user can manipulate the cursor to specify
rectangular portions of the screen or specific pixels to ray trace.  This
module has a help facility, accessible by typing a
.IR `?'\^ .
.sp
When using the Silicon Graphics IRIS in local mode, the user can use the
mouse to position the cursor and sweep out rectangular areas.
These operations require the user to press the middle mouse button to control
sweeping operations and the selection of positions.
The cursor module implementation on the IRIS also has a
.I window-in\^
and
.I window-out\^
command which allows the user to specify a translation and scaling of the grid
to include a smaller or larger, respectively, area of the model to ray trace.
.TP
.B E
Erase frame buffer.  Fill grid area of frame buffer with black.
.TP
.B F
Animate on-screen movie.
This command is currently only implemented on the IRIS,
and displays movies such as those generated with this program (see below).
.TP
.BR H "\ [file]"
Save frame buffer image.
Stores the image on the current frame buffer in
.IR file\^ .
This can also be used to transfer the image to another graphics device.
.TP
.BR h "\ [file]"
Restore a saved image from
.IR file\^ .
Reads the image from the specified file or device and displays it on the
current frame buffer.
.TP
.B J
Make a movie.
This command prompts for information necessary to set up a movie.
In specifying the number and size of frames to shoot,
the user is limited by the graphics device's display memory
(the entire movie must fit in the frame buffer).
.TP
.BR j "\ [file]"
Input key-frame from
.IR file\^ .
This command reads a saved view as output by
.IR mged\^ (1)
when using the
.I saveview\^
or
.I savekey\^
commands.
.TP
.BR L "\ id"
Modify light source data base entry
.IR id\^ .
The user will be prompted for information necessary to position and describe
the light source.
Light source zero has special significance and a dual purpose.
It simulates an ambient light source and,
its position specifies the position of the observer (the eye).  Note that only
the program's (in-core) copy of the data base is modified until another command
(see below) is used to write it to a file.
.TP
.BR l "\ id"
Print light source data base entry
.IR id\^ .
Display the current copy of the specified entry on the terminal's screen.
If no entry is specified, all entries will be displayed.
.TP
.BR M "\ id"
Modify the material data base entry
.IR id\^ .
The user will be prompted for information necessary to describe the properties
of the material necessary for the lighting model calculations.  As with the
light source data base, a seperate command (see below) is used to save the
current modifications in a file.
.TP
.BR m "\ id"
Print material data base entry
.IR id\^ .
Display the current copy of the specified entry.
The
.I id\^
should match the material id in the
.IR mged (1)
data base.
If no entry is specified, all entries will be displayed.
.TP
\fBq \fIor \fB^D
Quit. Normal exit from the program.
.TP
.B R
Ray trace current view.
Initiate a run.
During a batch mode run,
this command will be given automatically on encountering an
.I end-of-file\^
if
it hasn't been given explicitly.
Note that if an explicit
.I quit\^
command is given,
an
.I end-of-file\^
condition will not be encountered.
.TP
.B r
Redraw the terminal screen.
.TP
.BR S "\ [file]"
Save an executable script in
.IR file\^ .
Writes out a Bourne shell script which will restart the program with the current
set of options.  Note that the user should also use the commands (see below) to save
the light source and material data bases before quitting.
.TP
.BR V "\ [file]"
Save light source data base in
.IR file\^ .
.TP
.BR W "\ [file]"
Save material data base in
.IR file\^ .
.TP
.BR z "\ ulen vlen [width]"
Specify size of texture map as
.I ulen\^
by
.IR vlen\^ .
The optional
.I width\^
is for specification of the length of padded scan lines in the texture map file.
.TP
.BR N "\ [temperature]"
Specify temperature for IR painting.
.TP
.B P
Print
.IR mged\^ (1)
regions  and associated IR temperature mappings.
.TP
.B Q
Assign IR temperature to
.IR mged\^ (1)
region or group.
.TP
.BR U "\ [file]"
Save IR data base in
.IR file\^ .
.TP
.BR u "\ [file]"
Read IR data base from
.IR file\^ .
.TP
.B Z
Display pseudo-color IR mapping scale.
.SH HINTS
This program is designed to be used in two modes; interactively for setting
up parameters, and in batch mode for rendering high-resolution images.
First, the user should invoke the program in the interactive mode without options.
While in this mode,
the user should set up parameters for a low resolution ray trace,
perhaps by using the default resolution (32x32 grid),
ray trace that view, tweak parameters as necessary, and iterate.
As the user converges on the acceptable combination of parameters,
there is a command which will save a UNIX shell script.
This command generates a shell
script that will invoke the program with the current set of parameters,
data bases, objects, etc.  When everything is to the user's liking, he or
she should increase the resolution to 512 or 1024 (typically a full-screen
picture), change the output device to a file name so as not to tie up a
graphics device, make sure that the error output is being re-directed to
a file as well, and that all changes to the material or light data bases
have been written out.  Finally, the user can either spawn a batch run with
a command, or use the above mentioned command to save a shell script and
either quit or proceed to set up another view.  The command to create
a batch run actually executes the
.IR batch\^ (1)
command (subject to
.I MDQS\^
availability), with the current set of parameters, etc.  As an alternative
to generating a batch run from the program, the script files can be fed
by hand to the
.IR batch\^ (1)
command or can just be detached as background jobs (see EXAMPLES for
the proper method) with their input redirected from a file or
.IR /dev/null\^.
If the program is detached without re-directing its input, the full-screen
display will be generated which will tie up that terminal or layer (in
a windowed environment).
If the program is running in batch mode,
and it detects an
.I end-of-file\^
before the command is
given to generate an image, it will generate one automatically.
.SH EXAMPLES
The following command will start up an interactive session which will
use the Silicon Graphics IRIS's default frame buffer device (/dev/sgi)
on a host address 
.I viva.brl.mil\^
to display the
.I hull\^
and 
.I turret\^
of the target description in file
.IR tank.g\^ .
.RS
$ \|\fIlgt \|\-o \|viva.brl.mil: \|tank.g \|hull \|turret\fR
.RE
.sp
This command will start up an interactive session on an alternate device
on a remote host and will begin at the 251st scan line and complete a
512x512 image (handy in the event that the computer goes down in the
middle of ray tracing an image).  Note that since the
.I -y\^
option takes 2 arguments, they must appear in double-quotes.
.RS
$ \|\fIlgt \|\-G512 \|\-o \|vgr.brl.mil:/dev/ik1l \|\-y \|``250 511'' \|tank.g \|hull \|turret\fR
.RE
.sp
This will run the program as a detached process by executing a saved script called
.IR tankscript\^ .
