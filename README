.IP "VERSION"
.sp
This document is printed from the README file in the BRL-CAD distribution.
The version in the printed manuals are usually somewhat older
than the version on the actual distribution tape.
When attempting to
install the software, please refer to the documentation
versions actually contained on the distribution tape.
.sp
.IP CONTENTS
.sp
This README file exists only to provide you a brief roadmap to
the contents of the BRL-CAD distribution tape.
The information on how to read the tape,
install and operate the software,
and perform the benchmark tests have become sufficiently large
that they are now each a standalone document.
.sp
Please note that
this distribution package does \fInot\fR include
the various military-specific model
analysis tools such as GIFT, SAR, SLAVE, VAST, etc., nor does it
include any military databases.
If you desire to have access to this material,
please contact Keith Applin at (301)-278-6647.
.sp
.IP "INSTALLATION"
.sp
To install the BRL-CAD Package see the instructions in doc/install.doc.
This file includes directions on the best way to read the distribution
tape,
as well as details on how to configure and install the software.
This file also includes directions on how to compile and run
the benchmark tests.
.sp
.IP "BENCHMARK"
.sp
See the paper in doc/benchmark.doc for information on
analyzing the results of the benchmark tests.
Comparisons between various different computers are listed.
.sp
.IP "BACKGROUND MATERIAL"
.sp
For overview information on the whole package, consult
the overview paper in the file papers/overview, and
the brlcad(1) manual page in the file util/brlcad.1.
For a discussion of the significance of this software,
read the paper "Understanding the Preparation and Analysis of Solid
Models", included in the file papers/solid-models.
.sp
.IP "DISTRIBUTION DETAILS"
.sp
This section is included in the README file for two purposes.
First, we wish to remind you of the terms of this limited distribution.
Second, if you have obtained a copy of the printed documentation, and now
wish to obtain a copy of the software, the procedures are listed here.
.sp
To obtain a copy of the distribution, you should send the authors:
.sp
1)  Enough magnetic tape for 20 Mbytes of data. Standard nine-track
half-inch magtape is the strongly preferred format, and can be written
at either 1600 or 6250 bpi, in TAR format with 10k byte records. For
sites with no half-inch tape drives, Silicon Graphics and SUN tape
cartridges can also be accommodated, using QIC-24 format.
.sp
2)  A letter indicating:
.sp
.nf
	-- Who you are
	-- What the BRL-CAD package is to be used for
	-- The equipment and operating system(s) you plan on using
	-- That you agree to the conditions listed below.
.fi
.sp
It is vital that your letter include a sentence acknowledging your
agreement to the conditions, such as "We agree to the
conditions of the distribution listed in your letter".
This software is an unpublished work that is not generally available to the
public, except through the terms of this limited distribution.
The United States Department of the Army grants a royalty-free,
nonexclusive, nontransferable license and right to use,
free of charge, with the following terms and conditions:
.sp
1.  The BRL-CAD package source files will not be disclosed to third
parties.  BRL needs to know who has what, and what it is being used for.
.sp
2.  BRL will be credited should the software be used in a product or written
about in any publication.  BRL will be referenced as the original
source in any advertisements.
.sp
3.  The software is provided "as is", without warranty by BRL.
In no event shall BRL be liable for any loss or for any indirect,
special, punitive, exemplary, incidental, or consequential damages
arising from use, possession, or performance of the software.
.sp
4.  When bugs or problems are found, you will make a reasonable effort
to report them back to BRL.
.sp
5.  Before using the software at additional sites, or for permission to
use this work as part of a commercial package, you agree to first obtain
authorization from BRL.
.sp
6. You will own full rights to any databases or images you create with this
package.
.sp
All requests from US citizens, or from US government agencies should be
sent to:

.fi
.sp
If you are not a US citizen (regardless of any affiliation with a
US industry), or if you represent a foreign-owned or foreign-controlled
industry, you must send your letter and tape through your Ambassador to
the United States in Washington DC. Have your Ambassador submit the
request to:
.sp
.nf

	Army Headquarters
	Attn: DAMI-FL
	Washington, DC  20310
.fi
.sp
Because distribution tapes are written by various members of the
development team in their spare time, and because of vagaries in
the supply of printed manuals, the turnaround time for responding
to distribution requests varies from 1 to 12 weeks.

.IP "COMMUNICATION"
.sp
You are invited to participate in the DARPA InterNet (aka "ARPANET")
electronic mailing list on the BRL-CAD software, which is called
.sp .5
.ti +1i
<CAD @ BRL.MIL>.
.sp .5
Bug reports and discussions of new features
are the main topics;  volume of messages has been light (so far).
Direct your bug reports to this address.  Request a subscription by
sending to
