.SH DESCRIPTION
This library exists to permit writing MGED databases from
arbitrary procedures.
Some of the high-level structure of MGED databases (eg, that
they start with an ID record, and that COMB records must be
followed immediately by MEMBER records) is currently implicit
in the calling routines.
This library is by no means complete, and routines for writing every
type of solid do not yet exist.
While it is expected that this library will grow and change as
experience is gained, it is not clear what direction that evolution
will take.  Be prepared for changes in the interface to some of these
routines in future releases.
All routines take as their first argument the stdio FILE pointer
(eg, stdout) on which the generated MGED database record(s) will
be written with fwrite().
.PP
.I mk_id\^
fwrites an IDENT record on the indicated stdio file, with the string
.I title\^
associated.  Note that to have a valid database, the
the first record written must have been an IDENT record such as
written by this routine.
.PP
.I mk_half\^
makes a halfspace with name ``name''.  It is specified by
the distance ``d'' from the origin, and the outward pointing
normal vector ``norm''.
.PP
.I mk_rpp\^
makes an ARB8 called ``name''
specified as a right rectangular parallelpiped in
terms of a minimum point ``min'' and a maximum point ``max''.
.I mk_arb4\^
makes an ARB8 called ``name''
described as an ARB4, ie, by 4 points, the first 3 of which
lie on a plane, and the fourth is the ``peak''.
.I mk_arb8\^
makes an ARB8 called ``name''
described by an array of 8 points in ``pts''.
All plates with 4 points must be co-planar.
If there are degeneracies (ie, all 8 vertices are not distinct),
then certain requirements must be met.
If we think of the ARB8 as having a top and a bottom plate,
the first four points listed must lie on one plate, and
the second four points listed must lie on the other plate.
.PP
.I mk_sph\^
makes a spherical ellipsoid called ``name''
centered at point ``center'' with radius ``radius''.
.I mk_ell\^
makes an ellipsoid called ``name'' centered at point ``center''
with three perpendicular radius vectors.
The eccentricity of the ellipsoid is controlled by the relative
lengths of the three radius vectors.
.PP
.I mk_tor\^
makes a torus called ``name'' centered at point ``center'',
with the torus lying in a plane with normal ``n''.
Radius ``r1'' is the distance from the center point of the torus
to the center of the solid part, and radius ``f2'' is
the radius of the solid part.
.PP
.I mk_rcc\^
makes a truncated general cone (TGC) with name ``name''
specified as a right circular cylinder.
The base plate of the cylinder is centered at ``base'',
with height vector ``height'' which is perpendicular to
the two end plates, the length of which defines the location of
the top plate.
The radius given as ``radius'' defines the size of the end plates.
.PP
.I mk_comb\^
defines a conbination of name ``name'', with material properties
information included.
``len'' indicated the number of
.I mk_memb\^
calls (MEMB records) that will immediately follow.
``region'' is a boolean that is set to mark this combination
as a region.
``matname'' is either a NULL pointer, or a pointer to a string
containing the material property name.
``matparm'' is either a NULL pointer, or a pointer to a string
containing the material property parameter information,
which is material-specific (and still experimental).
Color is passed as an array of three unsigned chars in ``rgb''.
Color ``inherit'' is a boolean, and if true, the color and material
properties will be passed from upper-level objects to lower-level
objects.
.I mk_fcomb\^
makes a simple combination header, with name ``name'', length ``len'',
and the boolean ``region''.  It functions just like
.IR mk_comb\^ .
``len''
.I mk_memb\^
calls must immediately follow the call to
.I mk_comb\^
or
.IR mk_fcomb\^ .
Each call to
.I mk_memb\^
adds a reference to object ``name'' to the combination.
It is transformed by the 4x4 matrix ``mat'', and is combined
by boolean operation ``op'', chosen from
the list of:  UNION, INTERSECT, SUBTRACT, from <brlcad/db.h>.
.PP
.I mk_addmember\^
is used to obtain dynamic storage for a new wmember structure 
(see
.IR wdb.h\^
).  Then 
.I mk_lcomb\^
can be used in the same way as 
.I mk_comb\^
to make a combination of a linked list of wmember structures.
This is easier and less risky to use, because it produces the 
combination and member records all at once, rather than in two
calls, as in 
.I mk_comb\^
and
.I mk_memb\^
.PP
.I mk_polysolid\^
writes the header record for a polygon solid called ``name'',
which must be immediately
followed by one or more
.I mk_facet\^
calls before using any other
.I mk_*\^
routines.
.I mk_facet\^
is called with ``npts'' (3 to 5) vertices in the ``vert'' array,
with a matching number of normals in the ``norm'' array.
All vertices must be coplanar.
For the present, note that librt/pg.c only uses the first normal
in the ``norm'' array, although the intention is to do optional
normal interpolation for those occasions where it may be desirable
to have curved-looking polygons.
.PP
The routine
.I mk_bsolid\^
writes the header for a b-spline solid ``name'', with ``nsurf'' surfaces,
at ``res'' resolution.  This call must be followed by ``nsurf''
calls to 
.I mk_bsurf\^
which enters the respective surfaces into the combination.  This pair 
work much like the 
.I mk_comb\^
and 
.I mk_memb\^ 
pair.

.SH BUGS
The library is incomplete.
The need for the application to know higher-level details
is unfortunate, but necessary to keep the library simple.
We may pay for this later.
