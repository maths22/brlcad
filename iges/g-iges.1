.TH G-IGES 1 BRL-CAD
.SH NAME
g-iges \- IGES Translator (BRL-CAD to IGES)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B iges-g
[-f|c] [-v] [-a abs_tol] [-r rel_tol] [-n norm_tol] [-o file.iges] database.g object(s)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I g-iges\^
converts the specified objects of the BRLCAD database,
.I database.g
, to an IGES version 5.1 file,
.I file.iges.
The
.B \-f
option selects a BREP IGES file consisting of only Manifold Solid BREP
Objects.  All CSG solids in the specified objects are tesellated to
produce facetted BREP objects, then the indicated Boolean operations
are performed for each region. Individual regions are written to the
IGES file as individual BREP objects.  This procedure results in
some approximations since curved surface solids, such as TGC's or
ellipsoids, are approximated by flat facets. The accuracy of the
tesellation may be controlled through the use of the
.B \-a, -r, and -n
options to specify tolerances.
The
.B \-c
option selects a preference for a CSG IGES file. Under this option,
all regions will be written to the IGES file as Boolean trees with
all possible solids represented by their IGES CSG equivalent. In cases
where there is no IGES CSG equivalent, the BRLCAD solid is tesellated
(using the provided tolerances), and a BREP object is written for that
solid.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
.ce
\fIg-iges -f -o sample.iges sample.g object1\fR
.fi
This command will produce an IGES BREP output file,
.I sample.iges,
from
.I object1
of the BRLCAD database file
.I sample.g.
