This document describes the BRL-CAD Benchmark Test Methodology,
and the Ray-Tracing Figure of Merit (RTFM) used to judge the
computational performance of different computer systems.
.PP
The core of the test is the \fBrt\fR ray-tracing program.
The results for each processor are determined by
running a benchmark test of the RT ray-tracing program on each of the sample
databases provided.
The \fBrt\fR program requires a binary database for input ("db/xxx.g"), and
produces a binary image as output ("bench/xxx.pix"), along with a log
file ("bench/xxx.log").
Each run will produce a 512x512x24 bit color
shaded image in a "bench/xxx.pix" file, and a run log in "bench/xxx.log".
Reference copies of the images are provided as "pix/xxx.pix" and
"pix/xxx.log".  The sample databases provided are processed in
order of increasing difficulty, and each produces a colorful image.  In
each picture there are two light sources; the primary source is located
near the center of the model (the white ball), and the secondary light
source is located at the "eye" position.

The Benchmark Models
.LP
moss.g  --  This is a simple model, containing a yellow torus,
a green ellipsoid, a bluish cube, a pink truncated (distorted) cone,
all sitting on a blue plate.  Note the shadowing, and "specular splash".
.sp
world.g -- The same model as moss.g, but with various rendering
features enabled.  The model is enclosed in a hollow cloud sphere.
The plate is a mirror, the egg is crystal, the box has a debugging
texture map applied.
.sp
star.g  --  A familiar sight to Star Trek fans;  a low-detail exterior
of the ship "Enterprise".  The hull is white, with some other structures
in other colors.  The small red object in the foreground is the
shuttlecraft Galileo, to scale.
.sp
bldg391.g  --  An exploded view of a two-story imaginary computer site,
including various walls, red stairways, green disk drives, etc.
The lower floor is a mirror, the upper floor is glass.
.NH 1
MACHINE INDEPENDENCE
.PP
To make the benchmark
distribution machine independent,
the databases are provided
in an ASCII format in the "db" directory, and
ascii-to-binary converters are provided in the "conv" directory.
The setup command "\fBcake benchmark\fR"
(see the document \fIInstalling the BRL-CAD Package\fR)
will automaticly compile and run the converters.
.PP
If you are running this
benchmark on a non-UNIX machine that has difficulty writing binary
streams, change the "-o file.pix" flag to "-O file.a_pix" and RT
will write an ASCII form directly.  For more discussion, consult
the doc/pix.5 and conv/asc2pix.1 manual pages.
.PP
The reference images are distributed in binary BRL-CAD
.BR pix (5)
format.
Earlier releases distributed the reference images in the portable
ASCII form, and the converted them to the binary form.
This consumed a significant amount of extra storage on UNIX machines,
so this practice was discontinued.
It is assumed that anyone attempting to benchmark a system that
can not read pure binary files will at least have access to a
UNIX system that can be used to convert the reference images to
the portable ASCII form with the
.BR pix2asc (1)
tool, and then send those images to the machine under test.
.PP
If you encounter difficulty
with running the benchmark,
you might wish to build the full BRL-CAD package, to
take advantage of the image tools in determining the nature of the problem.
For example, one system suffered from a compiler bug that made
TGC solids vanish, while another system had difficulties with
the light visibility calculations.
.NH 1
OBTAINING CORRECT RESULTS
.PP
The benchmark timings are not considered valid unless
the correct results are given.
Make sure that the answers match the reference files
to within plus-or-minus one in each color (see pixdiff(1)).
Slight variations in the calculated pixels are generally attributable
to variations in floating point precision.
You may wish to
compare the execution times and log file remarks
from your tests (in the "bench/xxx.log" files) with the
VAX-11/780 (with hardware FPA) times which are given in the
"pix/xxx.log" files.
The reference images are also located in the "pix/" directory.
.PP
For example,
if you are running the benchmark on a Cray XMP,
the world.pix and bldg391.pix images will have a single byte in the
blue channel off by 1, out in the cloud background.  This is not to be
considered an error.
.NH 1
BENCHMARK IMAGE DISPLAY
.PP
If you have a suitable framebuffer,
you may wish to
display the images generated by the benchmark, and compare them
to the reference images.
This section assumes that you have successfully compiled the
full set of BRL-CAD software, not just the benchmark portion.
Programs for dealing with images are in the "util" directory.
To display a \fBpix\fR(5)
file on a framebuffer, set environment variable FB_FILE
(see \fBbrlcad\fR(1)
for details), and run \fBpix-fb\fR.  Note that by leaving
FB_FILE unset, your default display will be used.
.sp
.nf
.ft B
	cd bench
	pix-fb moss.pix
.ft R
.fi
.sp
If the images computed on your machine do not match the reference images,
the program "util/pixdiff" will compute a pix file that will highlight
the differences for you, and report a summary of bytes equal, off-by-1,
and off-by-many, e.g.,
.sp
.ft B
	pixdiff moss.pix ../pix/moss.pix \(or pix-fb
.ft R
.fi
.sp
For a display of the relative magnitude of the differences at
each pixel, use "util/bwdiff" instead, e.g.,
.sp
.nf
.ft B
	bwdiff moss.pix ../pix/moss.pix \(or pix-fb
.ft R
or
.ft B
	bwdiff moss.pix ../pix/moss.pix \(or \\
	bwmod -s 128 -m 4 -a 128 \(or pix-fb
.ft R
.fi
.sp
and for statistics on the differences, use
.sp
.ft B
	bwdiff moss.pix ../pix/moss.pix \(or pixstat
.ft R

THE COMPETITION

Here is the list of systems that have been tested so far,
with as much information about the configuration as could be obtained.
Some systems have a great many options for small things that can
affect performance, such as memory interleaving.

BENCHMARK RESULTS
.PP
In the tradition of Dongarra, the Rays/sec figure is considered the
"RT Figure of Merit" (RTFM).  Note that the RTFM can only be compared
between different runs on the \fIsame\fR database;  it is not meaningful
to compare RTFM numbers between different databases. The Rays/sec number
for a multi-processor machine is for "aggregate CPU cluster seconds",
rather than rays/total CPU seconds (which remains fairly constant on
good parallel machines). Worthy finalists to date are listed below.
Entries are omitted for tests in which correct results were not
obtained.
.LP
The statistics are recorded in
an easily understood format, with all results for
a particular configuration listed on a single line.
The numbers reported are the rays/sec (RTFM) figure.

hardware model name/number,
OS/compiler software version numbers,
presence or absence of floating point hardware,
and the local name (preferably InterNet or UUCP) of the
specific machine used.
