#  This shell script is intended for use with the MGED "rrt"	#
#  (remote RT) command.  It takes the local copy of the model	#
#  database, converts it to ASCII, and sends it over the 	#
#  network to a compute server machine (at BRL, usually either	#
#  a Cray or Alliant), where it is converted back into a binary	#
#  file in /tmp.  RT (on the compute server) is started, with	#
#  the viewing matrix provided on stdin, from the MGED rrt	#
#  command.							#
#								#
#  If the environment variable FB_FILE is set before MGED is	#
#  run, then we arrange to force the image to be routed to that	#
#  display (it better be in host:device form!).  This can be	#
#  overriden by supplying a -F option to the "rrt" command.	#
#								#
#  If the environment variable COMPUTE_SERVER is set before	#
#  MGED is run, that network host is used to perform the	#
#  raytracing.  Otherwise, BRL's XMP48 is used by default.	#
#								#
#  The compute server is assumed to have a different floating	#
#  point format than the local machine, hence the conversion	#
#  to ASCII.  The procedure can be simplified for machines of	#
#  identical binary database format.  The procedure becomes	#
#  almost trivial when compatible machines have NFS too.	#
